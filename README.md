# About

This is a personal project created to deepen my knowledge of React Native and mobile application development.

The main goal of the app is to help users register and track their workouts, serving as a practical playground to explore concepts such as:

- Component-driven architecture
- Design systems (theme, typography, spacing)
- Native modules and TurboModules
- Android and iOS platform differences
- Performance and layout behavior (keyboard handling, safe areas, animations)

This project is continuously evolving as new features and architectural improvements are added during the learning process.

**_ Although this is a personal project, the codebase follows real-world practices and patterns commonly used in production apps. _**
